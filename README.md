# Cheshire

Cheshire is a minimal Linux-capable host platform built around the RISC-V [CVA6](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) core. Its goal is to provide a *lightweight*, *configurable*, *autonomously booting* host to systems that need one, from minimal Linux-capable SoCs to manycore compute accelerators.

Cheshire is developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## Quick Start

* To learn how to build and use Cheshire, see [Getting Started](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/gs/).
* To learn about available simulation, FPGA, and ASIC targets, see [Targets](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/tg).
* For detailed information on Cheshire's inner workings, consult the [User Manual](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/um/).

If you are impatient and have all needed [dependencies](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/gs/#dependencies), you can run `make all`, then start QuestaSim in `target/sim/vsim` and run a [simulation](https://pulp-platform.github.io/cheshire/tg/sim) by typing:

```
set BINARY ../../../sw/tests/helloworld.spm.elf
source compile.cheshire_soc.tcl
source start.cheshire_soc.tcl
run -all
```
